# Python pass by:
In Python, variables work with pass by object reference (pass by assignment). This behavior simplifies into two categories:

1. Mutable objects (like lists, dictionaries, sets):
	- When you pass a mutable object to a function, any changes
	  made to the object inside the function will affect the original object.
	- Reassigning tho, does not change the original object, only manipulation, like appending
2. Immutable objects (like integers, strings, tuples):
	- When you pass an immutable object, any attempt to modify
	  it within the function creates a new object instead of altering the original.

# Python: Mutable vs Immutable Objects

1. **Object Creation**:
   - Immutable: Cannot be changed after creation (e.g., int, str, tuple).
   - Mutable: Can be changed in place (e.g., list, dict, set).

2. **Aliasing**:
   - Immutable: Two variables reference the same object, changes do not apply since they're immutable
   - Mutable: Both variables point to the same object, changes affect both.

3. **Cloning**:
   - Shallow Copy: Creates a new object but not for nested objects.
   - Deep Copy: Creates an independent copy of the entire object structure.

4. **Two Variables with the Same Value**:
   - python only automatically reuses memory for some small immutable objects like integers, chars & strings.
   - For tuples (and other complex objects), Python doesn't always perform this optimization.

   Mutable objects (lists, dict, sets)

    -----Empty and non-empty instances are different objects, resulting in is returning False. ------

   >>> a = {} // Dictionary (Empty) - diferrent object
   >>> b = {}
   >>> a is b
   False
   >>> b = [] // list (Empty) - diferrent object
   >>> a = []
   >>> a is b
   False
   >>> a = [4, 5] // list (None-empty) - diferrent objects
   >>> b = [4, 5]
   >>> a is b
   False
   >>> a = {'a': 1} // Dictionary (None-empty) - diferrent objects
   >>> b = {'a': 1}
   >>> a is b
   False

   Immutable objects (int, char, str, tuples)
   
   ----- common types like strings, ints, and chars are the same object for optimization
   ----- Floats and none empty tuples are diferrent objects
   ----- An empty tuple is the same object

   >>> a = 6 // integers - same object
   >>> b = 6
   >>> a is b
   True
   >>> a = 'x' // character - same object
   >>> b = 'x'
   >>> a is b
   True
   >>> a = "me" // string - same object
   >>> b = "me"
   >>> a is b
   True
   >>> a = 5.5 // float - diferrent object
   >>> b = 5.5
   >>> a is b
   False
   >>> a = () // Tuple (Empty) - same object
   >>> b = ()
   >>> a is b
   True
   >>> a = (4, 5) // Tuple (None-empty) - diferrent objects
   >>> b = (4, 5)
   >>> a is b
   False

5. **Behavior as Objects**:
   - Everything is an object with identity, type, and value.
   - Immutable: Fixed identity and value.
   - Mutable: Fixed identity, changeable value.
