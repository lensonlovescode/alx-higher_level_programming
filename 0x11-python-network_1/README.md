# Learning Objectives: Web Requests in Python

This project aims to solidify your understanding of making web requests in Python. After completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone, without relying on external resources like Google:

## General Concepts

* **Fetching Internet Resources with `urllib`:**  Explain how to use the `urllib` package to retrieve data from web URLs.  This includes understanding how to open URLs, read data, and handle potential errors.
* **Decoding `urllib` Body Response:** Describe the process of decoding the response body received from a `urllib` request. This includes handling different encodings (e.g., UTF-8) and converting the raw bytes into usable strings.
* **Using the `requests` Package:** Explain the advantages of using the `requests` package over `urllib` for making HTTP requests.  Highlight its simplicity and ease of use.
* **Making HTTP GET Requests:** Describe how to construct and send HTTP GET requests using the `requests` package.  Explain how to include parameters in the URL and handle the response.
* **Making HTTP POST/PUT/etc. Requests:** Explain how to make other HTTP requests like POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., using the `requests` package.  Focus on how to send data in the request body (e.g., form data, JSON).
* **Fetching JSON Resources:** Describe how to retrieve data from web resources that return JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data.  Explain how to parse the JSON response and work with the data in Python.
* **Manipulating Data from External Services:** Explain the general process of interacting with external web services or APIs. This includes understanding how to make requests, handle responses, and process the data received from the service.
